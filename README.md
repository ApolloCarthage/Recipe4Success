# Recipe4Success
Desktop Application of Recipe4Success
IT326 Software Development Project
Hello, friends!

## Project Information

This application, temporarily codenamed "Recipe4Success," is a recipe and meal plan management application which will allow users to enter or download recipes, edit their steps and ingredients, tag them with useful categories, and place them in comprehensive meal plans. These meal plans can then be used to generate grocery lists and allow users to always know exactly what they plan to eat, when they plan to eat it, and what ingredients they need to buy to make the recipe's in their recipe book.

### Development Mission

This project is currently being developed as a part of our IT326 course at Illinois State University with the mission of receiving an A in the course, but is being developed with the intention of being a useful application in its own right past the class that inspired it. Our mission is to create an app that is useful to anyone, but especially students with busy lives and a desire to save time planning and making their tasty meals.
